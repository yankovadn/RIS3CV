            <header>Introduction</header><br>
                <p>Smart specialization is one of the most central pillars of the EU’s reformed Cohesion policy. Contrary to traditional sector-neutral (horizontal) approaches,
                    smart specialization requires regions to concentrate their investments on a limited number of context-specific research and innovation priorities. Yet, this
                    increase of public support alone is not enough to trigger meaningful structural change unless it is coupled with policy instruments that enhance the existing
                    R&I network and strengthen cooperation among the different innovation ecosystem stakeholders. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Valencia’s Smart Specialization Strategy was officially approved by the regional government in 2014. The total budget allocated in the strategy for the 2014-2023
                    period exceeds 1.6 billion Euros, making it one of the most important public policy instruments for stimulating regional research and innovation. About 75% of the
                    public funds designated for the implementation of RIS3 are managed by two public institutions: the Valencian Innovation Agency (AVI) and the Valencian Institute
                    for Business Competitiveness (IVACE). In this study we look at the R&I network that emerged as a result of the collaborative open calls launched annually by the 
                    two entities. More specifically we consider the following open calls:
                    <br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>R&D in cooperation (IVACE)</li>
                        <li>Strategic projects in cooperation (AVI)</li>
                        <li>Consolidation of the business value chain (AVI)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <i>Note: IVACE’s objectives are geared toward assisting regional SMEs in increasing their competitiveness and overall innovative capacity. Hence, the open calls
                        launched by IVACE target primarily private businesses. AVI, on the other hand, seeks to enhance collaboration between universities, research centers, the
                        public administration and the private sector.</i>

                <p>The map below shows the spatial distribution of innovative actors (private companies, research centers, universities, associations, etc.) who requested public
                    funding for carrying out collaborative R&D projects at one of the three open calls outlined above. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The links between actors represent collaborative R&D projects, which can be filtered by year via the box on the right-hand side. Note that the map includes both
                    approved and rejected projects.</p>

                <p>The graphic below shows the total number of R&D partnerships per year which requested funding from AVI and IVACE during the 2016-2021 period. Rejected project
                    applications are displayed in a darker shade. The tool on the top right-hand side can be used to toggle between the two public funding bodies. <i>Note that AVI
                    was established in 2018.</i>

                <header>The role of geographical distance</header><br>
                <p>The graph below shows the distribution of the geographical distance (measured in km) between the pairs of partners. Across all 6 years of observations,
                    we note that the distance between many partners is less than 20 km. This spatial proximity between the collaborating actors implies that they most likely knew 
                    each other before entering in a consortium, putting into question the extent to which the policy instruments implemented by AVI and IVACE actually stimulated
                    the formation of new links as opposed to reinforcing existing network connections. <br> <br> Alternatively, the short distance between the actors may also signal 
                    that they are members of the same cluster, in which case we can argue that the implementation of the open calls helped strengthen some sector-specific micro-networks
                    across the region.</p>
