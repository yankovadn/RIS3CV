                <p>Valencia´s Smart Specialization Strategy was officially approved by the regional government in 2014. The document provides a comprehensive roadmap for the design of public R&D policies and actions in the region. The total budget allocated in the strategy for the 2014-2023 period exceeds <b>1.6 billion</b> Euros, making it one of the most important public policy instruments for stimulating regional research and innovation. Below we offer an overview of the collaborative knowledge networks which were produced as a result of the implementation of RIS3 instruments in the Valencian region. The objective of this interactive dashboard is to provide further insight for both policy makers and the general public regarding the effectiveness of RIS3. </p>

                <p>The map below shows the spatial distribution of innovative actors (private companies, research centers, universities, associations, etc.) who requested public funding for carrying out collaborative R&D projects at one of the following open calls of AVI and IVACE: (1) Proyectos estratégicos en cooperación (2) Cadena de valor empresarial (3) Proyectos en cooperación. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The links between actors represent collaborative R&D projects, which can be filtered by year via the box on the righthand side. Node that the map includes both approved and rejected projects.</p>

                <p>The graphic below shows the total number of R&D partnerships per year which requested funding from AVI and IVACE during the 2016-2021 period. Rejected project applications are displayed in a darker shade. The tool on the top right handside can be used to toggle between the two public funding bodies. Note that AVI was established in 2018. </p>
